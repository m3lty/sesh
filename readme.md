# A web app for finding other local people interested in Tabletop Roleplaying Games.


This project relies heavily on code I wrote for my Sesh project, this code will be cleaned up eventually.
## Current Features
* Users can create an account with custom avatar and profile.
* Users can create a Group with set locations, campaign description, and RPG system of choice.
* Users may join other member's Groups to show interest in meeting up and playing.


## Planned Features
* Users will be able to leave comments on Group pages.
* Users will be able to leave comments on other member's profiles.
* Users will be able to mark themselves as a Game Master, or as willing to teach certain Systems.
* Ability to make private tables which will require the owner's permission to join.
